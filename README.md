## Resources
This project requires a `main` dumped from the latest *Lego City Undercover - EU* update, v1.0.3
(The US version 1.0.2 likely also works for decompilation, but is untested and has a different file hash).
The Japanese version isn't currently supported, because it was compiled with a different/unknown compiler version
similar to the other 1.0.0 versions.

# How to help
If you want to help with the decompilation, then you can do either the todos below, check for possible todo comments in
the code, decompile functions/classes, improve readability of functions or fix non-matching functions. You can also
check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to contribute.

# Todo
- add GitHub actions for linting and fix lint.py
- create a file structure for the functions/classes based on the symbols
- Code style guidelines
- (if possible) improve progress tracking

## Why Nintendo Switch Edition?
The Nintendo Switch Edition has symbols, making it a good base for decompilation. The Wii U Edition doesn't have symbols
and the compiler toolchain GHS is abysmal. The chance that we find a matching compiler version is next to none, so our
assembly wouldn't be matching either way.

The Nintendo Switch Edition on the other hand was compiled with Clang where it's easier to find the compiler version just by the release date of the game.
